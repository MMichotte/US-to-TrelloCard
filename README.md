# User-Story to Trello-Card

It has always been a struggle to translate a bunch of well-documented User-Stories written in a markdown or a text file to corresponding Trello cards. 

This project gives you the ability to automate this process just by adding a few `tags`to your User-Stories. 
The tags are nothing more than html comments and are therefor not visible when displayed on github. 

----
## üè∑ Available tags:

| Opening tag | Closing tag | Description | Required |
|:-----------:|:-------------:|:-----------:|:--------:|
| `<!--us-->` | `<!--/us-->`    | Delimits a User Story | ‚úÖ
| `<!--title-->` | `<!--/title-->` | Delimits the name that will be given to the card, stripped of any `#` character. | ‚úÖ
| `<!--description-->` | `<!--/description-->` | Delimits the text that will appear in the cards description. | ‚úÖ
| `<!--checklist: "your checklist name"-->` | `<!--checklist-->` | Delimits the items that should be added to a checklist. The checklist will be created with as title the name you pass in between the `"`characters in the opening tag. |
| `<!--img-->` | `<!--/img-->` | Delimits an image inserted in your .md file that should be uploaded as attachment to the card and included in the description. | 

‚ùóÔ∏è The user-story won't be added if your US doesn't have the required tags.
